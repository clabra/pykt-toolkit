## 📈 **Performance Optimization Insights**

### **Why Performance is Maintained**
1. **Architectural Intelligence**: Constraints built into model structure, not loss penalties
2. **Educational Alignment**: Perfect consistency actually helps learning representation
3. **Regularization Effect**: Constraints prevent overfitting to spurious patterns
4. **Semantic Coherence**: Monotonic mastery improves meaningful skill representation
