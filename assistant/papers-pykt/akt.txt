ABSTRACT
Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to the problem of predicting future
learner performance given their past performance in educational
applications. Recent developments in KT using flexible deep neural
network-based models excel at this task. However, these models of-
ten offer limited interpretability, thus making them insufficient for
personalized learning, which requires using interpretable feedback
and actionable recommendations to help learners achieve better
learning outcomes. In this paper, we propose attentive knowledge
tracing (AKT), which couples flexible attention-based neural net-
work models with a series of novel, interpretable model compo-
nents inspired by cognitive and psychometric models. AKT uses
a novel monotonic attention mechanism that relates a learner’s
future responses to assessment questions to their past responses;
attention weights are computed using exponential decay and a
context-aware relative distance measure, in addition to the sim-
ilarity between questions. Moreover, we use the Rasch model to
regularize the concept and question embeddings; these embeddings
are able to capture individual differences among questions on the
same concept without using an excessive number of parameters.
We conduct experiments on several real-world benchmark datasets
and show that AKT outperforms existing KT methods (by up to 6%
in AUC in some cases) on predicting future learner responses. We
also conduct several case studies and show that AKT exhibits excel-
lent interpretability and thus has potential for automated feedback
and personalization in real-world educational settings.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in data analytics and intelligent tutoring systems
[32] have enabled the collection and analysis of large-scale learner
data; these advances hint at the potential of personalized learning
at large scale, by automatically providing personalized feedback
[24] and learning activity recommendations [ 11] to each learner by
analyzing data from their learning history.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3394486.3403282A key problem in learner data analysis is to predict future learner
performance (their responses to assessment questions), given their
past performance, which is referred to as the knowledge tracing
(KT) problem [ 3]. Over the last 30 years, numerous methods for
solving the KT problem were developed based on two common
assumptions: i) a learner’s past performance can be summarized
by a set of variables representing their current latent knowledge
level on a set of concepts/skills/knowledge components, and ii) a
learner’s future performance can be predicted using their current
latent concept knowledge levels. Concretely, let tdenote a set of
discrete time indices, we have the following generic model for a
learner’s knowledge and performance
rt∼f(ht),ht∼д(ht−1),
where rt∈{0,1}denotes the learner’s graded response to an as-
sessment question at time step t, which is usually binary-valued
(1corresponds to a correct response and 0corresponds to an in-
correct one) and is observed. The latent variable htdenotes the
learner’s current knowledge level and is not observed. f(·)andд(·)
are functions that characterize how learner knowledge dictate their
responses and how it evolves; they are sometimes referred to as the
response model and the knowledge evolution model, respectively.
Earlier developments in KT methods before 2010 can be divided
into two classes. The first class centered around the Bayesian knowl-
edge tracing (BKT) method [ 19,35] where knowledge ( ht) is a
binary-valued scalar that characterizes whether or not a learner
masters the (single) concept covered by a question. Since the re-
sponse ( rt) is also binary-valued, the response and knowledge evo-
lution models are simply noisy binary channels, parameterized by
the guessing, slipping, learning, and forgetting probabilities. The
second class centered around item response theory (IRT) models
[16] and use these models (especially sigmoidal link functions) as
the response model f(·); learner knowledge level is then modeled as
real-valued vectors ( ht) for questions that cover multiple concepts.
Among these methods, the SPARFA-Trace method [ 13] used a sim-
ple affine transformation model as the explicit knowledge evolution
modelд(·). Other methods, e.g., additive factor models [ 1], perfor-
mance factor analysis [ 22], the difficulty, ability, and student history
(DASH) model [ 15], and a few recent methods including knowledge
factorization machines [ 30] and an extension to the DASH model,
the DAS3H model [ 2], used hand-crafted features such as the num-
ber of previous attempts, successes, and failures on each concept
in their knowledge evolution model. Methods in both classes rely
on expert labels to associate questions to concepts, resulting in
excellent interpretability since they can effectively estimate the
knowledge level of each learner on expert-defined concepts.
Recent developments in KT centered around using more sophisti-
cated and flexible models to fully exploit the information contained

in large-scale learner response datasets. The deep knowledge trac-
ing (DKT) method [ 23] was the first method to explore the use
of (possibly deep) neural networks for KT by using long short-
term memory (LSTM) networks [ 7] as the knowledge evolution
modelд(·). Since LSTM units are nonlinear, complex functions, they
are more flexible than affine transformations and more capable of
capturing nuances in real data.
The dynamic key-value memory networks (DKVMN) method
extended DKT by using an external memory matrix ( Ht) to char-
acterize learner knowledge [ 36]. The matrix is separated into two
parts: a static, “key” matrix that contains the fixed representation of
each concept, and a dynamic, “value” matrix that contains the evolv-
ing knowledge levels of each learner on each concept. DKVMN
also uses separate “read” and “write” processes on this external
matrix for the response and knowledge evolution models; these
processes make it even more flexible than DKT. DKT and KVMN
reported state-of-the-art performance in predicting future learner
performance [ 9] and have been the benchmark for new KT methods.
The self-attentive knowledge tracing (SAKT) method [ 18] is
the first method to use attention mechanisms in the context of
KT. Attention mechanisms are more flexible than recurrent and
memory-based neural networks and have demonstrated superior
performance in natural language processing tasks. The basic setup
of SAKT has many similarities to the Transformer model [ 29], an
effective model for many sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks.
However, we observe that SAKT does not outperform DKT and
DKVMN in our experiments; see Section 4 for details. Possible
reasons for this include i) unlike in language tasks where strong
long-distance dependencies between words are more common, the
dependence of future learner performance on the past is likely
restricted to a much shorter window, and ii) the sizes of learner
response datasets are several magnitudes lower than natural lan-
guage datasets and are less likely to benefit from highly flexible
and large-scale attention models.
More importantly, no existing KT method truly excels at both fu-
ture performance prediction and interpretability. Early KT methods
exhibit excellent interpretability but do not provide state-of-the-art
performance on future learner performance prediction. Recent KT
methods based on deep learning excel at that but offer limited in-
terpretability. Therefore, these KT methods do not fully meet the
needs of personalized learning, which requires not only accurate
performance prediction but also the ability to provide automated,
interpretable feedback and actionable recommendations to help
learners achieve better learning outcomes.
1.1 Contributions
For the task of predicting the learner’s response to the current ques-
tion, we propose the attentive knowledge tracing (AKT) method,
which uses a series of attention networks to draw connections be-
tween this question and every question the learner has responded
to in the past. We summarize our key innovations below:
(1)Contrary to existing attention methods that use raw question
and response embeddings, we put raw embeddings into con-
text and use context-aware representations of past questions
and responses by taking a learner’s entire practice history into
account.(2)Inspired by cognitive science findings on the mechanisms of for-
getting, we propose a novel monotonic attention mechanism that
uses an exponential decay curve to down weight the importance
of questions in the distant past. We also develop a context-aware
measure to characterize the time distance between questions a
learner has responded to in the past.
(3)Leveraging the Rasch model, a simple and interpretable IRT
model, we use a series of Rasch model-based embeddings to
capture individual differences among questions without intro-
ducing an excessive amount of model parameters.
We conduct a series of experiments on several benchmark real-
world educational datasets comparing AKT to state-of-the-art KT
methods. Our results show that AKT (sometimes significantly) out-
performs other KT methods in predicting future learner perfor-
mance. Further, we perform ablation studies on each of the key AKT
model components to demonstrate their value. We also perform sev-
eral case studies to show that AKT exhibits excellent interpretability
and has the potential for automated feedback and practice question
recommendation, both key requirements of personalized learning1.
2 KNOWLEDGE TRACING PROBLEM SETUP
Each learner’s performance record consists of a sequence of ques-
tions and responses at each discrete time step. For learner iat time
step t, we denote the combination of the question that they an-
swered, the concept this question covers, and their graded response
as a tuple,(qi
t,ci
t,ri
t), where qi
t∈N+is the question index, ci
t∈N+
is the concept index, and ri
t∈{0,1}is the response. Under this
notation,(qi
t,ci
t,1)means learner iresponded to question qi
ton
concept ci
tcorrectly at time t. We note that this setup is different
from some prior works on deep knowledge tracing that often ig-
nore the question index and summarize learner performance as
(ci
t,ri
t). This choice was made to avoid overparameterization; see
Section 3.3 for a detailed analysis. In the following discussions, we
omit the superscript ias we discuss how to predict future perfor-
mance for a single learner. Given their past history up to time t−1
as{(q1,c1,r1), . . . ,(qt−1,ct−1,rt−1)}, our goal is to predict their
response rtto question qton concept ctat the current time step, t.
2.1 Question and Response Embeddings
Following previous work [ 36], we use real-valued embedding vec-
torsxt∈RDandyt∈RDto represent each question and each
question-response pair ( qt,rt), respectively. xtcharacterizes in-
formation about questions, and ytcharacterizes the knowledge
learners acquire by responding to questions, with two separate
embeddings for correct and incorrect responses, respectively. D
denotes the dimension of these embeddings. Therefore, let Qdenote
the number of questions, there are a total of Qquestion embed-
ding vectors and 2Qquestion-response embedding vectors. In most
real-world educational settings, the question bank is considerably
larger than the set of concepts and many questions are assigned to
very few learners. Therefore, the majority of existing KT methods
use concepts to index questions to avoid overparameterization; all
questions covering the same concept are treated as a single question.
In this case, qt=ctandQ=C.

3 THE AKT METHOD
The AKT method consists of four components: two self-attentive
encoders, one for questions and one for knowledge acquisition,
a single attention-based knowledge retriever, and a feed-forward
response prediction model; Figure 1 visualizes the AKT method
and its connected components.
We use the two self-attentive encoders to learn context-aware
representations of the questions and responses. We refer to the first
encoder as the question encoder, which produces modified, contex-
tualized representations of each question, given the sequence of
questions the learner has previously practiced on. Similarly, we
refer to the second encoder as the knowledge encoder, which pro-
duces modified, contextualized representations of the knowledge
the learner acquired while responding to past questions. Alterna-
tively, we could use raw embeddings of questions and responses
similar to prior work. We found that the context-aware representa-
tion performs better in most datasets. We refer to the knowledge
evolution model as the knowledge retriever, which retrieves knowl-
edge acquired in the past that is relevant to the current question
using an attention mechanism. Finally, the response prediction
model predicts the learner’s response to the current question using
the retrieved knowledge. The AKT method is motivated by three
intuitions rooted in cognitive science and psychometrics; we will
detail these intuitions in what follows.
3.1 Context-aware Representations and The
Knowledge Retriever
As introduced above, we use two encoders in our model. The ques-
tion encoder takes raw question embeddings {x1, . . . , xt}as in-
put and outputs a sequence of context-aware question embed-
dings{ˆx1, . . .,ˆxt}using a monotonic attention mechanism (de-
tailed in the next subsection). The context-aware embedding of
each question depends on both itself and the past questions, i.e.,
ˆxt=fenc 1(x1, . . . , xt). Similarly, the knowledge encoder takes
raw question-response embeddings {y1, . . . , yt−1}as input and
outputs a sequence of actual knowledge acquired {ˆy1, . . . , ˆyt−1}
using the same monotonic attention mechanism. The context-aware
embedding of acquired knowledge depend on the learner’s re-
sponse to both the current question and past questions, i.e., ˆyt−1=
fenc 2(y1, . . . , yt−1).
The choice of using context-aware embeddings rather than raw
embeddings reflects our first intuition: the way a learner compre-
hends and learns while responding to a question depends on the learner.
These modified representations reflect each learner’s actual compre-
hension of the question and the knowledge they actually acquire,
given their personal response history. This model choice is mo-
tivated by the intuition that for two learners with different past
response sequences, the way they understand the same question
and the knowledge they acquire from practicing on it can differ.
The knowledge retriever takes the context-aware question and
question-response pair embeddings ˆx1:tand ˆy1:t−1as input and
outputs a retrieved knowledge state htfor the current question.
We note that in AKT, the learner’s current knowledge state is also
context-aware since it depends on the current question they are
responding to; this model choice is different from that in mostexisting methods, including DKT. We also note that the knowl-
edge retriever can only use information on the past questions, the
learner’s responses to them, and the representation of the current
question, but not the learner’s response to the current question, i.e.,
ht=fkr(ˆx1, . . . , ˆxt,ˆy1, . . . , ˆyt−1). The response prediction model
uses the retrieved knowledge to predict the current response.
3.2 The Monotonic Attention Mechanism
We use a modified, monotonic version of the scaled dot-product
attention mechanism for the encoders and the knowledge retriever.
We start by briefly summarizing the original scaled dot-product
attention mechanism. Under this framework, each encoder and the
knowledge retriever has a key, query, and value embedding layer
that maps the input into output queries, keys, and values of dimen-
sion Dq=Dk,Dk, and Dv, respectively. Let qt∈RDk×1denote
the query corresponding to the question the learner responds to at
time t, the scaled dot-product attention values αt,τare computed
using the softmax function [5] as
αt,τ=Softmax(q⊺
tkτp
Dk)=exp(q⊺
tkτ√Dk)
Í
τ′exp(q⊺
tkτ√Dk)∈[0,1].
The output of the scaled dot-product attention mechanism is then
given byÍ
ταt,τvτ∈RDv×1.kτ∈RDk×1andvτ∈RDv×1denote
the key and value for the question at time step τ, respectively.
Depending on the specific component, the output depends either on
both the past and the current ( τ≤tfor the question and knowledge
encoders) or only the past ( τ<tfor the knowledge retriever).
Both encoders employ the self-attention mechanism, i.e., qt,kt,
andvtare computed using the same input; the question encoder
uses{x1, . . . , xt}while the knowledge encoder uses {y1, . . . , yt−1}.
The knowledge retriever, on the other hand, does not use self-
attention. As shown in Fig. 1, at time step t, it uses ˆxt(the modified
embedding of the current question), {ˆx1, . . . , ˆxt−1}(the context-
aware embeddings of past questions), and {ˆy1, . . . , ˆyt−1}(the
context-aware embeddings of past question-response pairs) as in-
put to generate the query, keys, and values, respectively. We note
that SAKT uses question embeddings for mapping queries whereas
response embeddings for key and value mapping. In our experi-
ments, we have found that using question embeddings for mapping
both queries and keys is much more effective.
However, this basic scaled dot-product attention mechanism is
not likely going to be sufficient for KT. The reason is that learning
is temporal and memories decay [ 21]; a learner’s performance in
the distant past is not as informative as recent performance when
we are predicting their response to the current question. Therefore,
we develop a new monotonic attention mechanism that reflects our
second intuition: when a learner faces a new question, past experi-
ences i) on unrelated concepts and ii) that are from too long ago are
not likely to be highly relevant. Specifically, we add a multiplicative
exponential decay term to the attention scores as:
αt,τ=exp(st,τ)Í
τ′exp(st,τ′),

whereθ>0is a learnable decay rate parameter and d(t,τ)is tem-
poral distance measure between time steps tandτ. In other words,
the attention weights for the current question on a past question de-
pends not only on the similarity between the corresponding query
and key, but also on the relative number of time steps between
them. In summary, our monotonic attention mechanism takes the
basic form of an exponential decay curve over time with possible
spikes at time steps when the past question is highly similar to
the current question. We note that we apply exponential decay to
the attention weights rather than latent knowledge, which is the
common approach in existing learner models (see e.g., [17, 26]).
We note that there are many other possible ways to characterize
the temporal dynamics of attention. First, in language tasks that
attention networks excel at, the temporal dynamics can be mod-
eled using additive positional embeddings or learnable embeddings
[29]. Second, in our monotonic attention mechanism, we can also
parameterize the exponential decay as st,τ=q⊺
tkτ√Dk−θ·d(t,τ).
However, neither of these changes lead to comparable performance
to our chosen model setup; we will compare AKT against its vari-
ants using positional encoding rather than monotonic attention in
our experiments.
A context-aware distance measure. The exponential decay
function decides the rate at which the attention weights decay
as the distance between the current time index and the previous
time indices increase. A straightforward way to define the distance
between two time indices is their absolute value difference, i.e.,d(t,τ)=|t−τ|. However, this distance is not context-aware and
ignores the practice history of each learner. For example, consider
the two following sequences of concepts a learner practiced on:
Venn Diagram (VD)1,VD2,···,VD8,Prime Numbers (PN) 9,PN10
and
PN1,VD2,VD3,···,VD9,PN10,
where the notation “ V D2” means that the learner practiced the
concept of Venn Diagram at time step 2. In this example, the learner
answers a question on Prime Numbers at t=10, i.e., the current
time index, in both of these sequences, but the most recent past
practice on Prime Numbers comes at different time indices. Since
the concepts of Venn Diagram and Prime Numbers are not closely
related, the learner’s previous practices on Prime Numbers is more
relevant to us when predicting their answer to the current practice
question than recent practices on Venn Diagram. In this case, with
the straightforward absolute value difference, an exponential decay
curve will significantly reduce the attention weight assigned to the
practice on Prime Numbers at t=1.
Therefore, we propose the following context-aware distance
measure between time steps d(t,τ)withτ≤tfor the exponential
decay mechanism (in the encoders):
d(t,τ)=|t−τ|·tÕ

================================================================================

For the knowledge retriever, we replace τ′≤twithτ<tand
t′≤twith t′<tcorrespondingly. In other words, this context-
aware distance measure uses another softmax function to adjust
the distance between consecutive time indices according to how
the concept practiced in the past is related to the current concept. In
practice, in each iteration during model training, we use the current
AKT model parameters to compute the modified distance measure
and fix it; we do not pass gradients through the distance measure.
Multi-head attention and sub-layers. We also incorporate
multi-head attention which is effective in attending to past posi-
tions at multiple time scales [ 29]. Therefore, we use Hindependent
attention heads where every head has its own decay rate θ, concate-
nate the final output into a (Dv·H)×1vector and pass it to the next
layer. This model design enables AKT to summarize past learner
performance at multiple time scales, which bears some similarities
to the multiple time windows in the multiscale context, DASH,
and DAS3H models [ 2,15,21]. We also use several sub-layers, in-
cluding one for layer normalization [ 14], one for dropout [ 27], a
fully-connected feedforward layer, and a residual connection layer
[6] in each encoder and the knowledge retriever.
3.3 Response Prediction
The last component of the AKT method predicts the learner’s re-
sponse to the current question. The input to the prediction model
is a vector that concatenates both the retrieved knowledge (the
knowledge retriever output ht) and the current question embed-
ding xt; this input goes through another fully-connected network
before finally going through the sigmoid function [ 5] to generate
the predicted probability ˆrt∈[0,1]that the learner answers the
current question correctly. All learnable parameters in the entire
AKT method are trained in end-to-end fashion by minimizing the
binary cross-entropy loss of all learner responses, i.e.,
ℓ=Í
iÍ
t−(ri
tlogˆri
t+(1−ri
t)log(1−ˆri
t)).
3.4 Rasch Model-Based Embeddings
As we discussed above, existing KT methods use concepts to index
questions, i.e., setting qt=ct. This setup is necessary due to data
sparsity. Let Qdenote the total number of questions and Ldenote
the number of learners. In most real-world learner response datasets,
the number of learner responses is comparable to CLand much
less than QLsince many questions are assigned to few learners.
Therefore, using concepts to index questions is effective in avoiding
overparameterization and overfitting. However, this basic setup
ignores the individual differences among questions covering the
same concept, thus limiting the flexibility of KT methods and their
potential for personalization.
We use a classic yet powerful model in psychometrics, the Rasch
model (which is also known as the 1PL IRT model) [ 16,25], to con-
struct raw question and knowledge embeddings. The Rasch model
characterizes the probability that a learner answers a question cor-
rectly using two scalars: the question’s difficulty, and the learner’s
ability. Despite its simplicity, it has shown to achieve comparable
performance to more sophisticated models on learner performance
prediction in formal assessments when knowledge is static [ 12,31].
Specifically, we construct the embedding of the question qtfromDataset Learners

where cct∈RDis the embedding of the concept this question
covers, and dct∈RDis a vector that summarizes the variation in
questions covering this concept, and µqt∈Ris a scalar difficulty
parameter that controls how far this question deviates from the
concept it covers. The question-response pairs (qt,rt)from concept
ctare extended similarly using the scalar difficulty parameter for
each pair:
yt=e(ct,rt)+µqt·f(ct,rt),
where e(ct,rt)∈RDandf(ct,rt)∈RDare concept-response em-
bedding and variation vectors. This model choice reflects our third
intuition: questions labeled as covering the same concept are closely
related but have important individual differences that should not be
ignored. This model choice is partly inspired by another work in
fusing KT and IRT models [8].
These Rasch model-based embeddings strike the right balance
between modeling individual question differences and avoiding
overparameterization. For the question embeddings, the total num-
ber of embedding parameters in this model is 2CD+Q, which
is slightly more than that in a model that uses concepts to index
questions ( CD), but much less than that in a model where each
question is parameterized individually ( QD), since C≪Qand
D≫1. We further define the concept-response embeddings as
e(ct,rt)=cct+grt, where g1andg0denote the embeddings for
correct and incorrect responses (regardless of the concept), respec-
tively. Therefore, we only introduce a total of (C+2)D+Qnew
embedding parameters instead of 2CD+Qnew parameters for
the concept-response embeddings. We note that our question and
question-response embeddings share a group of parameters ( cct);
this setting is different from existing neural network-based KT
methods where the two are independent of each other. These com-
pact embedding representations significantly reduce the number
of parameters in not only AKT but also some other KT methods,
leading to improved performance on future learner performance
prediction; see Table 5 for details.

In this section, we detail a series of experiments we conducted to
test on several real-world datasets. We evaluate AKT both quantita-
tively through predicting future learner responses and qualitatively
through a series of visualizations and case studies.

datasets: ASSISTments2009, ASSISTments2015, ASSISTments20172,
and Statics2011.3The ASSISTments datasets were collected from
an online tutoring platform; in particular, the ASSISTments2009
dataset has been the standard benchmark for KT methods over the
last decade. The Statics2011 dataset was collected from a college-
level engineering course on statics. On all these datasets, we follow
a series of standard pre-processing steps in the literature. For the
ASSISTments2009 dataset, we remove all interactions that are not
associated to a named concept. For the ASSISTments2015 dataset,
we remove all interactions where the “isCorrect” field is not 0 or 1.
We list the numbers of learners, concepts, questions, and question-
response pairs in Table 1. Out of these datasets, only the ASSIST-
ments2009 and ASSISTments2017 datasets contain question IDs;
therefore, the Rasch model-based embeddings are only applicable
to these two datasets.
Baseline methods and evaluation metric. We compare AKT
against several baseline KT methods, including BKT+ [ 35], DKT,
DKT+ (which is an improved version of DKT with regularization
on prediction consistency [ 34]), DKVMN [ 36], and the recently
proposed self-attentive KT (SAKT) method [ 18], which uses an
attention mechanism that can be viewed as a special case of AKT
without context-aware representations of questions and responses
and the monotonic attention mechanism. We use the area under
the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) as the metric to
evaluate the performance of all KT methods on predicting binary-
valued future learner responses to questions.
Training and testing. For evaluation purposes, we perform
standard k-fold cross-validation (with k=5) for all models and
all datasets. Thus, for each fold, 20%learners are used as the test
set,20% are used as the validation set, and 60% are used as the
training set. For each fold, we use the validation set to perform
early stopping and tune the parameters for every KT method.
We truncate learner response sequences that are longer than 200,
following [ 23,36], for computational efficiency reasons. If a learner
has more than 200responses, we break up their entire sequence
into multiple shorter sequences. We use the Adam optimizer to
train all models [ 10] with a batch size of 24learners to ensure that
an entire batch can fit into the memory of our machine (equipped
with one NVIDIA Titan X GPU). We implement all versions of AKT
inPyTorch ; We also re-implement DKT, DKT+, and SAKT, since
including question IDs requires new dataset partitions and leads
to new experimental results. We use the Xavier parameter initial-
ization method [ 4] for AKT, DKT, DKT+, and SAKT; for DKVMN,

we follow their work and use samples from normal distributions
to initialize the parameters [ 36]. We do not re-implement BKT+;
its performance on various datasets is taken from [ 36]. For most
datasets and most algorithms, one training epoch takes less than
10 seconds. We set the maximum number of epochs to 300.
4.2 Results and Discussion
Table 2 lists the performance of all KT methods across all datasets
on predicting future learner responses; we report the averages as
well as the standard deviations across five test folds. AKT-R and
AKT-NR represent variants of the AKT model with and without
the Rasch model-based embeddings, respectively. We see that AKT
(sometimes significantly) outperforms other KT methods on the
ASSISTments datasets while DKT+ marginally outperforms AKT
on the smallest Statics2011 dataset. In general, AKT performs better
on larger datasets; this result suggests that attention mechanisms
are more flexible than recurrent neural networks and are thus more
capable of capturing the rich information contained in large-scale
real-world learner response datasets. On the ASSISTments2015
and ASSISTments2017 datasets, AKT-NR improves the AUC by
6%and1%over the closest baseline. It performs on-par with the
best-performing baseline on the Statics2011 and ASSISTments2009
datasets. More importantly, on the ASSISTments2009 and 2017
datasets with question IDs, AKT-R significantly outperforms other
KT methods, by 2%and6%over the closest baseline, respectively. We
note that DKT outperforms the more advanced DKVMN method in
our implementation. While we are able to replicate the performance
of DKVMN using the same experimental setting [ 36], we found that

DKT performs much better than previously reported in that work.
DKT+ performs on-par with DKT, with minor improvements on
the Statics2011 dataset. We also observe that the RNN-based model,
DKT, outperforms SAKT on all datasets.
Ablation study. In order to justify the three key innovations in
the AKT method, context-aware representations of questions and re-
sponses, the monotonic attention mechanism, and the Rasch model-
based embeddings, we perform three additional ablation experi-
ments comparing several variants of the AKT method. The first ex-
periment compares AKT-NR and AKT-R using context-aware ques-
tion and response representations (with the question and knowl-
edge encoders) with two variants AKTraw-NR and AKTraw-R; In
these variants, we use raw question and response embeddings as
their representations instead of the context-aware representations
(i.e., without passing them through the encoders). The second exper-
iment compares AKT-NR against several variants without the mono-
tonic attention mechanism. These variants include AKT-NRpos,
which uses (learnable) positional encoding to capture temporal de-
pendencies in learner response data and AKT-NRfixed, which uses
(fixed) positional encoding using different frequencies of sine and
cosine functions [ 29]. The third experiment compares AKT-R with
AKT-NR, DKT, DKT-R, DKT+, DKT+-R, DKVMN, DKVMN-R, SAKT,
and SAKT-R on the ASSISTments2009 and 2017 datasets where ques-
tion IDs are available; DKT-R, DKT+-R, DKVMN-R, and SAKT-R
refer to the DKT, DKT+, DKVMN, and SAKT methods augmented
with the Rasch model-based embeddings as input, respectively.
Table 3 shows the results (only averages and not standard de-
viations across test folds, due to spatial constraints) of the first
ablation experiment for the context-aware representations (i.e., the
question and knowledge encoders). On all datasets AKT-R and AKT-
NR outperform their counterparts, AKTraw-NR and AKTraw-R,
which use only a single self-attention mechanism with exponential
decay (i.e., the knowledge retriever). These results suggest that
our context-aware representations of questions and responses are
effective at summarizing each learner’s practice history.
Table 4 shows the results of the second ablation experiment for
the monotonic attention mechanism. We see that AKT-NR signifi-
cantly outperforms other attention mechanisms using positional
embeddings, including SAKT, by about 1%to6%on all datasets. We
postulate that the reason for this result is that unlike in language
tasks where strong long-distance dependencies between words are
more common, the dependence of future learner performance on
the past is restricted to a much shorter time window. Therefore,
using multi-head attention with different exponential decay rates
in the attention weights can effectively capture short-term depen-
dencies on the past at different time scales.

Rasch model-based embeddings on the two ASSISTments datasets

the added Rasch model-based embeddings outperform their reg-
ular versions, especially on the ASSISTments2017 dataset. These
results confirm our intuition that treating all questions covering
the same concept as a single question is problematic; individual
differences among these questions should not be ignored as long
as overparameterization can be avoided.
Remark. Our standard experimental setting follows that used
in [23,36]. In this setting, for questions tagged with multiple con-
cepts (in the ASSISTments2009 dataset), a single learner response
is repeated multiple times, one for each concept. Other works used
different experimental settings for these questions; In [ 31], the au-
thors removed such questions and as a result, DKT’s performance
dropped to 0.71. In [ 33], the authors built new concepts for each
combination of co-occurring single concepts and as a result, DKT’s
performance dropped to 0.73. Therefore, we also use an alternative
experimental setting on the ASSISTments2009 dataset. For a ques-
tion tagged with multiple concepts, we average the corresponding
concept embeddings and use them as both input embeddings and
for response prediction. Table 6 lists the performance of all KT
methods on the ASSISTments2009 dataset under this setting. DKT’s
performance dropped to 0.76 using average embeddings, faring
better than settings under [ 31,33]. We observe similar performance
drops compared to our standard experimental setting for all KT
methods, while AKT-R still comfortably outperforms all baselines.
4.3 Visualizing Learned AKT Parameters
Monotonic attention. Figure 2 shows the interpretability of-
fered by AKT’s monotonic attention mechanism using the ASSIST-
ments2009 dataset. Figure 2(a) visualizes the attention weights in
the knowledge retriever for one learner as an example; we plot the
attention weights used to predict their performance on 20 consec-
utive practice questions across three attention heads. We see that
each attention head operates on its own time scale: they all have
attention windows of different widths. For example, the second
head is capable of attending to the entire past, up to 20 time steps
(in this example); on the contrary, the third head can only attend to
the immediate past and focuses primarily on the last 3-5 time steps.
This observation suggests that some questions and responses in the
past contain information that is highly predictive of the learner’s
response to the current question; this information can be effectively
captured by multiple attention heads with different decay rates.

Figure 2: Visualizations of (a) attention weights in the decoder of
AKT for three attention heads and (b) attention weights for three
consecutive practice questions for a learner. Concept similarity and
recency are key factor that control the attention weights.
Figure 2(b) visualizes the normalized attention weights in the
knowledge retriever for a single learner for three consecutive time
steps. In the top row, the learner is responding to a question on
Concept 30 at time Tafter practicing this concept from T−10to
T−5, then taking a break to practice on Concept 42, before coming
back to Concept 30 at time T−1. We see that AKT predicts their
response to the current question by focusing more on previous
practices on this concept (both in the immediate past and further
back) than practices on another concept also in the immediate past.
In the middle row, the learner switches to practicing on Concept
42 again. Again, AKT learns to focus on past practices on the same
concept rather than the immediate past on a different concept at
times T−2andT−1. In the bottom row, the learner practices on
Concept 42 for the second consecutive time, and AKT shows a sim-
ilar focus pattern to that in the top row, with the roles of Concepts
30 and 42 swapped. These observations suggest that AKT’s mono-
tonic attention mechanism has the potential to provide feedback to
teachers by linking a learner’s current response to their responses
in the past; this information may enable teachers to select certain
questions that they have practiced for them to re-practice and clear
misconceptions before moving on. We also note that AKT, using a
data-driven approach, learns these attention patterns that match
hand-crafted features in existing KT methods (e.g., the number of
total attempts and correct attempts on this concept) [15, 22].

cepts using t-SNE [ 28] using the ASSISTments2009 dataset, together

culties. We see that questions on the same concept form a curve and
are ordered by their difficulty levels: for the majority of concepts,
questions on one end of the line segment are easy while questions
on the other end are hard. This result confirms our intuition that
questions from the same concept are not identical but closely re-
lated to each other; this relationship can be well-captured by the
Rasch model using its difficulty parameter.

“Conversion of Fractions to Percents”, and their learned difficulty
parameters. We show three questions for each concept: an easy one,
an average one, and a hard one. Using the “Probability of a Single
Event” concept as an example, the learned difficulty parameter
values (µq) are−0.0515 for the easy one, 0.0088 for the average one,
and0.0548 for the hard one. These learned difficulty levels match
our understanding about the difficulty levels of these questions.
These results suggest that AKT has the potential to be applied
in real-world educational settings. Using the estimated difficulty
parameters, a computerized learning platform can either i) auto-
matically select questions with appropriate difficulty levels for each
learner given their past responses, or ii) support teachers to adjust
course plans by providing them feedback on question difficulty
levels learned from real data. Therefore, AKT improves over exist-
ing KT methods by not only providing state-of-the-art predictive
performance but also exhibiting interpretability and potential for
personalized learning.
5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed attentive knowledge tracing, a
new method for knowledge tracing that relies fully on attention
networks. Our method improves upon existing knowledge tracing
methods by building context-aware representations of questions
and responses, using a monotonic attention mechanism to sum-
marize past learner performance in the right time scale, and by
using the Rasch model to capture individual differences among
questions covering the same concept. Experimental results on a
series of benchmark real-world learner response datasets show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KT methods and ex-
hibit excellent interpretability. Avenues of future work include i)
incorporating question text to further enhance the interpretability
of question and concept embeddings and ii) testing whether our
method can improve prediction performance on language learning
datasets where memory decay occurs [26].

Parameter tuning. For all methods, we use a two-layer, fully-
connected network for the response prediction model, with 512
and256hidden units in the first and second layers, respectively.
For AKT, we fix the number of attention heads to H=8and use
the same dimension for the queries, keys, and values for each head
in the encoders and the knowledge retriever, i.e., Dk=Dv=D/8

the query and key embedding layer in the attention mechanism.
We do not perform grid search over the values of these parame-
ters since the performance of KT methods is insensitive to theseparameters. For all methods, we use {256,512},{256,512}, and
{0,0.05,0.1,0.15,0.2,0.25}as values of the input embedding di-
mension, the hidden state dimension, and the dropout rate for the
feedforward network, respectively. We also use {1,10,∞}as values
of the maximum gradient norm for clipping [ 20] where∞means
no gradient norm clipping. For AKT, SAKT, and their variants, we
use{5×10−6,10−5,10−4}as values of the learning rate in the Adam
optimizer. For DKT, DKT+, and DKVMN, we use {10−4,10−3}as val-
ues of the learning rate. Additionally, for DKVMN, we use {20,50}
as values of the memory size parameter, following [ 36]. For DKT+,
we use{0.1,0.2},{0.3,1}, and{3,30}as values of the reconstruc-
tion regularization, the ℓ1-norm penalty, and the ℓ2-norm penalty
parameters, respectively, following [34].
