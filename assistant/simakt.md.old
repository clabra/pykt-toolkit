# SimAKT Architecture


## Introduction

The original Transformer was designed for seq2seq tasks like machine translation, where both the input and output are sequences of the same type of tokens (e.g., words). In contrast, Knowledge Tracing (KT) tasks involve input sequences composed of interaction data, including concept IDs, responses, and sometimes additional information such as problem/question IDs or timestamps. The output, is typically a prediction about the student's next response. 

The 'taxonomy.md' file provides a overview of the main models and challengues of the Transformer approach applied to the field of Konwledge Tracing and specifically, of the models implemented in this project. 


### From Intra-Student to Inter-Student Modeling: A Paradigm Shift 
 
A significant challenge in personalized learning systems is data sparsity. For new students or 
those with limited interaction history, the "intra-student information" is sparse and insufficient 
to train a reliable model. This issue mirrors a classic problem in recommender systems, 
where a cold-start user with no history is difficult to make recommendations for. The solution, 
in both domains, involves a shift from a purely individualized approach to one that leverages 
"inter-student information"—the collective intelligence of a peer group.

The central thesis of the paper is that a next major conceptual leap in knowledge tracing might be 
the integration of collaborative information. By identifying and leveraging the learning 
behaviors of "students who have similar question-answering experiences," a model can inform 
predictions for a given student, even when their own history is limited.

This paradigm shift addresses the fundamental limitation of data sparsity by allowing the model to draw on a 
richer, more extensive set of data from similar peers, providing a powerful supplement to a 
student's own historical sequence. 
 

### Defining "Collaborative Information" in Knowledge Tracing 
 
Within the context of knowledge tracing, "collaborative information" refers to the insights and 
signals derived from the learning behaviors of a group of learners, particularly those identified 
as similar to a target student. This goes beyond the traditional intra-student focus by 
explicitly modeling the relationships and collective patterns that exist across a student 
population. This approach is motivated by the observation that learners sharing similar 
cognitive states often display comparable problem-solving performances. 

Collaborative signals can manifest in several forms, each with its own architectural 
implications. The most direct form involves retrieving the full question-answering sequences 
of peers who have a history of similar interactions. A more abstract approach leverages 
pre-calculated or learned patterns, such as "Follow-up Performance Trends" (FPTs), that 
represent common learning trajectories derived from the entire student corpus. These 
trends, while not tied to a specific individual, still represent an aggregate form of collaborative 
information. The efficacy of a collaborative model is therefore fundamentally dependent on 
the definition of what constitutes "similarity" and how these external signals are integrated. 


### The Mechanisms of Similarity-Based Attention 
 
Traditional Transformer-based models like SAINT employ a self-attention mechanism that 
computes attention weights based on the relationships between tokens within a single 
sequence, such as a student's past interactions with exercises. For collaborative knowledge 
tracing, this mechanism must be redefined to calculate attention based on the similarity 
between different students or between a student and a pre-defined learning pattern. 
The core of this "similarity-based attention" involves a creative adaptation of the standard 
attention architecture. In a cross-attention setup, a "query" vector representing the current 
student's learning state can be used to query a set of "key" vectors derived from the 
representations of similar peers or collaborative patterns. The resulting attention score 
becomes a measure of semantic or behavioral similarity, which allows the model to assign 
higher weights to the most relevant peer interactions or patterns. The model's hidden 
representation for the current time step is then a weighted sum of the "value" vectors from 
these similar peers. This process allows the model to selectively and dynamically leverage the 
most pertinent collaborative information, thereby enhancing its ability to make accurate 
predictions, particularly when the intra-student data is sparse. The choice of what 
constitutes "similarity"—be it a simple metric on question-answering history or a complex, 
learned embedding—is a crucial design decision that fundamentally determines the model's 
capability and its computational complexity. 

In our case we will use an approach based in similarity of learning paths. The sequence of student interactions is preprocessed to have a sequence of tuples where each tuple can be consideerd a point in a trajectory. Then we will applied existent techniques to encode trajectories as h vectors. Two similar trajectories will have similar h vectors. 

    Each tuple (s, n, m) will contain information about: 
    - question or skill (s)
    - number of attempts (n): number of interactions of the student with the question or skill
    - mastery (m): level of mastery skill acquired after the number of attemps

Each tuple defines the learning curve for this skill. We use a sigmoid curve to model a monotonic learning curve that follows a pattern cahractrized by slow start, rapid improvement phase and a plateau effect once the skill has been mastered. 

 
### Current Similarity-based Models  
 
Some models exemplify the shift towards collaborative and similarity-based attention 
mechanisms. They each address the problem from a distinct architectural perspective, 
highlighting a growing consensus that collaborative information is a vital component for 
robust knowledge tracing. See section "3. In-Depth Examination of Relevant Models" of similarity-transformers.pdf" for a description of CoKT, FINER and Coral. 

## Questions for defining Learning Trajectory Similarity for SimAKT

  Let's systematically explore what "learning trajectory similarity" could mean and how to operationalize it:

  ### 1. Trajectory Components - What Makes Up a Learning Path?

  A student's learning trajectory could be represented as sequences of:

  A. Response Patterns

    Student A: [C, W, C, C, W, C] → skills [S1, S2, S1, S3, S2, S1]
    Student B: [W, W, C, C, C, C] → skills [S1, S2, S1, S3, S2, S1]

  B. Skill Mastery Evolution

    Student A: S1[0.2→0.6→0.8], S2[0.1→0.3→0.7], S3[0.0→0.5]
    Student B: S1[0.1→0.2→0.9], S2[0.2→0.4→0.6], S3[0.0→0.8]

  C. Learning Curve

    Student A: Fast initial learning, plateau effect
    Student B: Slow start, rapid improvement phase

Most models use A or B formats. **In SimAKT we'll use a "C. Learning Curve" format**. The learning curve is modeled through a sigmoid calculated from a (S, N, M) tuple that represent a point in the learning trajectory. 

    Each learning tuple (S, N, M) will contain information about: 
    - question or skill (S)
    - number of attempts (N): number of interactions of the student with the question or skill
    - mastery (M: level of mastery skill acquired after the number of attemps

We have M as the y and N as the x coordinate in the sigmoid curve characteristic of each S skill. After N attempts the student learns (achieves skill mastery level) or fails. 

  2. Multi-Dimensional Similarity Framework

As we characterize students by their sequences of learning curves, two similar trajectories in SimAKT mean that the students have been exposed to similar concepts (i.e. questions to train similar skills) with similar performance (i.e. they got simialr mastery levels after similar number of attempts).  


  3. Concrete Similarity Metrics Discussion

**PLANNED**: We plan to integrate the code in the `TSMini` folder to calculate similarities between trajectories. It uses an approach based on KNN and Attention mechanisms. Read TSMini/paper.pdf for a detailed explanation. Currently, the implementation uses basic cosine similarity as a foundation. 

  4. Key Design Questions for Discussion

  Q1: Granularity Level

TSMini uses a multiview, multigranular approach. 

  Q2: Skill Specificity
  - Global similarity across all skills vs skill-specific similarity?

SimAKT uses Global similarity. 

  - How to weight different skills in similarity computation?

The attention mechanisms should care abut what skills are more relevant. 

  Q3: Temporal Weighting
  - Should recent interactions matter more in similarity?
  - How to balance historical patterns vs current state?

We could add parameters for this if possible although this feature has no high priority in a first verison of the algorithm. 

  Q4: Interpretability Requirements
  - Should similarity be directly explainable to educators?
  - Need for decomposable similarity components?

Interpretability is given by the prediction of the N, M components that allows to predict the (S, N, M) tuple and therefore the learning curve for each skill. Learning curves allow to explain the SimAKT model predictions about correctnes of student responses. 

They allow, as well, to calculate the skill mastery level and from that figure out if the response would be correct or not. A sensible approach is: 

- If the mastery level given by the learning curve passes a threshold value (set by a parameter with a defualt value of, let's say 0.9) all skills required 

  5. Working Definition Proposal

**Learning Trajectory Similarity in SimAKT** is defined as the similarity between students' learning curves across multiple skills, where each curve is characterized by (S, N, M) tuples:

**Core Definition:**
- **Trajectory Representation**: Each student's learning trajectory is a sequence of (S, N, M) tuples where:
  - S = skill/question identifier
  - N = number of attempts on skill S
  - M = mastery level achieved after N attempts
- **Learning Curves**: Each skill S generates a sigmoid curve with N as x-coordinate and M as y-coordinate

**Similarity Computation:**
- **Method**: **CURRENT**: Basic cosine similarity with mathematical transformations. **PLANNED**: TSMini-based approach using KNN and attention mechanisms (see TSMini/paper.pdf)
- **Granularity**: **CURRENT**: 4 mathematical views of cosine similarity. **PLANNED**: Multi-view, multi-granular approach as implemented in TSMini
- **Scope**: Global similarity across all skills (not skill-specific)
- **Weighting**: Attention mechanisms determine skill relevance automatically

**Interpretability Features:**
- **Explainable Predictions**: Learning curves provide interpretable explanations for response correctness
- **Mastery Threshold**: Responses predicted as correct when mastery level M > threshold (default: 0.9) for required skills
- **Causal Reasoning**: "Students with similar learning curves for skills X,Y,Z typically achieve mastery after N attempts"

**Key Innovation:**
Unlike existing models that use response patterns (format A) or skill mastery evolution (format B), SimAKT uses learning curve format (C) enabling both response prediction AND skill mastery tracking through interpretable sigmoid curves.



## Structured Plan to Guide SimAKT Architecture Development

Based on the established learning trajectory similarity definition using (S, N, M) tuples and TSMini-based similarity computation, the following structured plan will guide SimAKT architecture development:

### Phase 1: Differentiation Strategy Analysis

**1.1 Existing KT Architecture Review**

Foundation Models Limitations:

1. SAKT (2019): Pure self-attention on interaction sequences

    - Limitation: Binary predictions only, no skill mastery tracking
    - Attention: Standard QKV, no similarity-based weighting

2. AKT (2020): Context-aware monotonic attention with Rasch model

    - Limitation: Still binary output, IRT integration but no learning curves
    - Attention: Monotonic with exponential decay, not trajectory-based

3. SAINT (2021): Encoder-decoder with separated exercise/response processing

    - Limitation: Complex architecture but still binary classification focus
    - Attention: Cross-attention between exercises and responses

Specialized Models and SimAKT Advantages:

4. RKT (2020): Relation-aware with forgetting behavior

    - Similar concept: Uses relationships between exercises
    - SimAKT advantage: Learning trajectory similarity vs exercise similarity

5. DTransformer (2023): Temporal and cumulative attention

    - Similar concept: Temporal awareness and knowledge-level diagnosis
    - SimAKT advantage: Interpretable learning curves vs complex TCA mechanism


**1.2 Key SimAKT Contributions**

  1. Output Innovation: Learning curves (sigmoid) vs binary predictions
  2. Attention Innovation: Trajectory similarity vs traditional QKV
  3. Interpretability: Causal explanations through learning curves
  4. Skill Mastery Tracking: Continuous mastery evolution vs point estimates

### Phase 2: Core Architecture Design

#### **2.1 Similarity-Based Attention Mechanism**
- Replace standard attention with trajectory similarity computation
- Design attention weight derivation from TSMini similarity scores
- Multi-head attention adaptation for different trajectory aspects (skill-specific, temporal, difficulty)


#### Traditional Attention vs SimAKT Similarity-Based Attention

    Traditional Transformer Attention:
    Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V

    SimAKT Similarity-Based Attention:
    Attention(trajectory_i, trajectory_set) = softmax(TSMini_sim(trajectory_i, trajectory_set)) ⊗ learning_curves

#### Core Architecture Design

  1. Trajectory Representation Layer

    - Input: Student interaction sequence → [(s₁, r₁, t₁), (s₂, r₂, t₂), ..., (sₙ, rₙ, tₙ)]
    - Processing: Convert to (S, N, M) trajectory tuples per skill
    - Output: Trajectory embeddings T = {T₁, T₂, ..., Tₖ} for k students

  2. TSMini Similarity Computation

    - Query Trajectory: Current student's learning trajectory Tᵢ
    - Key Trajectories: All historical student trajectories {T₁, T₂, ..., Tₖ}
    - Similarity Matrix: TSMini(Tᵢ, Tⱼ) → similarity scores ∈ [0,1]

  3. Attention Weight Derivation
  
    # Replace traditional softmax(QK^T) with TSMini similarity
    attention_weights = softmax(TSMini_similarity_scores)

  4. Value Integration

    - Values: Learning curve parameters from similar students
    - Weighted Aggregation: Similarity-weighted combination of (S, N, M) curves
    - Output: Predicted learning curve parameters for current student

#### Multi-Head Attention Implementation Status

**Currently Implemented:** 
- **Standard Multi-Head Structure**: 8 attention heads using traditional QKV projection
- **Basic Trajectory Similarity**: Simple cosine similarity computation between trajectory embeddings with 4 mathematical transformations:
  - View 0: Direct cosine similarity (baseline)
  - View 1: Squared cosine similarity (emphasizes high similarity) 
  - View 2: Exponential of cosine similarity (non-linear amplification)
  - View 3: Linear scaling of cosine similarity (weighted baseline)
- **Similarity-Weighted Attention**: Attention weights derived from basic trajectory similarity instead of dot-product

**NOTE**: This is NOT the full TSMini implementation. The current approach uses simple mathematical transformations of basic cosine similarity.

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Skill-Specific Similarity Head: Focus on trajectories for individual skills
- Temporal Pattern Similarity Head: Learning velocity and timing patterns
- Difficulty Progression Similarity Head: Response to increasing complexity
- Error Recovery Similarity Head: Mistake patterns and recovery strategies

#### Mathematical Formulation

    SimAKT Attention Mechanism:

    1. Trajectory Encoding: 
    
    T = Embed([(S, N, M)₁, (S, N, M)₂, ..., (S, N, M)ₛ])

    2. Multi-View Similarity:

    # CURRENT: Basic mathematical transformations of cosine similarity
    base_similarity = cosine_similarity(Tᵢ, Tⱼ)
    sim_view0 = base_similarity                    # Direct
    sim_view1 = base_similarity ** 2              # Squared
    sim_view2 = torch.exp(base_similarity)        # Exponential  
    sim_view3 = 2.0 * base_similarity            # Linear scaling
    
    # PLANNED: Full TSMini multi-metric approach
    # sim_skill = TSMini_skill(Tᵢ, Tⱼ)
    # sim_temporal = TSMini_temporal(Tᵢ, Tⱼ)
    # sim_difficulty = TSMini_difficulty(Tᵢ, Tⱼ)
    # sim_error = TSMini_error(Tᵢ, Tⱼ)

    3. Attention Weights (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION):

    α_view0 = softmax(sim_view0 / τ₁)     # Direct similarity
    α_view1 = softmax(sim_view1 / τ₂)     # Squared similarity
    α_view2 = softmax(sim_view2 / τ₃)     # Exponential similarity
    α_view3 = softmax(sim_view3 / τ₄)     # Scaled similarity

    4. Multi-Head Output (CURRENT):
    output = concat(α_view0⊗V, α_view1⊗V, α_view2⊗V, α_view3⊗V)
    
    # PLANNED: TSMini-based multi-head output
    # output = concat(α_skill⊗V_skill, α_temporal⊗V_temporal, α_difficulty⊗V_difficulty, α_error⊗V_error)

  #### Key Design Decisions

  Q1: How to handle cold-start students?
  - Solution: Use global average trajectories or nearest neighbor imputation
  - Fallback: Traditional attention when insufficient trajectory data

  Q2: Computational efficiency with large student populations?
  - Solution: TSMini's efficient similarity computation + attention caching
  - Optimization: Pre-compute similarity matrices for stable student pairs

  Q3: How to balance multiple similarity aspects?
  - Solution: Learnable attention head weights: w₁×α_skill + w₂×α_temporal + w₃×α_difficulty + w₄×α_error
  - Training: End-to-end learning of optimal similarity combination

  Q4: Integration with learning curve prediction?
  - Solution: Attention output directly feeds into sigmoid curve parameter estimation
  - Connection: Similarity-weighted (S, N, M) tuples → curve parameters

  #### Architecture Flow

    Input Sequence → Trajectory Extraction → TSMini Similarity → Multi-Head Attention → Learning Curve Prediction → Binary Classification + Interpretability

  This design replaces traditional QKV attention with trajectory similarity while maintaining the multi-head structure for different aspects of learning pattern similarity.


#### **2.2 Learning Curve Prediction Components**

#### From Attention Output to Learning Curves

**Input**: Similarity-weighted attention output from TSMini-based multi-head attention

**Output**: Skill-specific sigmoid learning curves + binary predictions + interpretability features

#### Core Pipeline Design

**1. (S, N, M) Tuple Aggregation**

From attention output, extract similarity-weighted trajectory information:
```
attention_output → {(S₁, N₁, M₁), (S₂, N₂, M₂), ..., (Sₖ, Nₖ, Mₖ)}
where each tuple represents weighted evidence for skill S after N attempts reaching mastery M
```

**2. Sigmoid Curve Parameter Estimation**

For each skill S, fit sigmoid curve: `M(N) = L / (1 + e^(-k(N-N₀)))`

Parameters to estimate:
- **L**: Maximum mastery level (asymptote) 
- **k**: Learning rate (steepness)
- **N₀**: Inflection point (attempts needed to reach 50% mastery)

**Estimation Methods**:
- **Method A**: Direct regression from (N, M) points from similar students
- **Method B**: Neural parameter prediction: `θ_sigmoid = NN(attention_output)`
- **Method C**: Bayesian parameter estimation with uncertainty quantification

**3. Skill Mastery Level Calculation**

For current student at attempt N for skill S:
```
current_mastery_S = L_S / (1 + e^(-k_S(N-N₀_S)))
```

**4. Threshold-Based Correctness Prediction**

```python
# Default threshold τ = 0.9
def predict_correctness(question_skills, current_masteries, threshold=0.9):
    required_skills = get_required_skills(question_skills)
    min_mastery = min([current_masteries[skill] for skill in required_skills])
    return min_mastery > threshold
```

#### Multi-Skill Integration

**Challenge**: Questions often require multiple skills

**Solution**: Skill composition strategies

**Strategy 1: Minimum Mastery**
```
P(correct) = min(mastery_S1, mastery_S2, ..., mastery_Sk) > threshold
```

**Strategy 2: Weighted Average**  
```
P(correct) = Σ(w_i × mastery_Si) > threshold, where Σw_i = 1
```

**Strategy 3: Conjunctive Model**
```
P(correct) = P(all required skills > threshold) = Π P(mastery_Si > threshold)
```

#### Learning Curve Quality Assessment

**Curve Validity Metrics**:
- **Monotonicity**: Ensure M(N+1) ≥ M(N) (no negative learning)
- **Bounded Growth**: 0 ≤ M(N) ≤ 1 (valid mastery range)
- **Convergence**: lim(N→∞) M(N) = L (reaches asymptote)

**Curve Confidence**:
- **Data Support**: Number of similar students with trajectory data for skill S
- **Similarity Scores**: Average TSMini similarity of contributing trajectories
- **Prediction Uncertainty**: Variance in parameter estimates

#### Dynamic Learning Curve Updates

**Real-time Adaptation**:
As student provides new responses, update curve parameters:

1. **New (S, N, M) tuple** from current interaction
2. **Re-run attention** with updated trajectory
3. **Refine sigmoid parameters** with new evidence
4. **Update mastery predictions** for all skills

#### Output Components

**Primary Outputs**:
1. **Binary Prediction**: Will next response be correct? (0/1)
2. **Mastery Levels**: Current mastery for each skill ∈ [0,1]
3. **Learning Curves**: Sigmoid parameters (L, k, N₀) per skill

**Interpretability Outputs**:
1. **Explanation**: "Based on students with similar learning patterns, you need ~N more attempts to master skill S"
2. **Trajectory Visualization**: Plot showing expected mastery progression
3. **Similarity Evidence**: Which students' trajectories contributed to prediction

#### Mathematical Formulation

**Complete Learning Curve Prediction Pipeline**:

```
1. Attention Aggregation:
   weighted_trajectories = Σ(α_j × trajectory_j) for j in similar_students

2. Parameter Estimation:
   θ_S = {L_S, k_S, N₀_S} = EstimateParams(weighted_trajectories[skill_S])

3. Mastery Calculation:
   mastery_S(N) = L_S / (1 + exp(-k_S × (N - N₀_S)))

4. Binary Prediction:
   y_pred = ThresholdFunction(min(mastery_Si for Si in required_skills))
```

#### Integration with SimAKT Architecture

**Connection to Attention Module**:
- Multi-head attention → skill-specific weighted trajectories
- Each head contributes different aspects (temporal, difficulty, error patterns)
- Combined output feeds sigmoid parameter estimation

**Loss Function Design**:
```
Total_Loss = λ₁×Binary_CrossEntropy + λ₂×Curve_MSE + λ₃×Regularization
where:
- Binary_CrossEntropy: Standard correctness prediction loss
- Curve_MSE: Mean squared error between predicted and actual mastery progression  
- Regularization: Ensures valid curve parameters (monotonic, bounded)
```

## TSMini Integration Analysis and Plan

### Current Trajectory Similarity Implementation

**Existing Implementation Status:**
The current SimAKT implementation includes a BASIC trajectory similarity computation using simple cosine similarity. This is NOT the full TSMini approach but serves as a foundation for future TSMini integration:

**Current Basic Similarity Class:**
- **Multi-view transformations**: 4 different mathematical transformations of basic cosine similarity (NOT true TSMini views)
- **Cosine similarity baseline**: Simple normalized dot-product computation between trajectory embeddings
- **Mathematical transformations**: Direct, squared, exponential, and linear scaling of cosine similarity
- **Integration point**: Used within MultiHeadSimilarityAttention to compute attention weights

**IMPORTANT**: This is NOT the TSMini implementation described in the paper. It's a simplified placeholder using basic cosine similarity.

**Current Trajectory Encoding:**
- **(S, N, M) tuple construction**: Skills, number of attempts, mastery level
- **Trajectory encoder**: Neural network to embed trajectory tuples
- **Learning curve integration**: Sigmoid curve parameters derived from trajectories

### TSMini Framework Analysis

**Key Components from TSMini Implementation (NOT YET INTEGRATED):**

1. **ConvEmbeder**: Convolutional trajectory embedding with stacked Conv1D layers - **PENDING INTEGRATION**
2. **Multi-Scale Attention (MSA-LLM)**: Transformer-based trajectory encoder - **PENDING INTEGRATION**
3. **Trajectory Similarity**: Comprehensive trajectory comparison with multiple distance metrics - **PENDING INTEGRATION**
4. **Training Pipeline**: Specialized loss functions for trajectory similarity learning - **PENDING INTEGRATION**

**STATUS**: The TSMini code exists in the /TSMini folder but has NOT been integrated into the SimAKT model. Current implementation uses basic cosine similarity only.

**TSMini Architecture Advantages:**
- **Patch-based embedding**: More efficient representation for long trajectories
- **Multi-scale processing**: Captures both local and global trajectory patterns
- **Learned similarity**: End-to-end trainable similarity computation
- **Caching mechanism**: Efficient similarity computation for large trajectory databases

## Technical Details

### Similarity-Based Attention Mechanism

**Traditional Attention**: `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V`

**SimAKT Attention**: `Attention(trajectory_i, trajectory_set) = softmax(TSMini_sim(trajectory_i, trajectory_set)) ⊗ learning_curves`

### Learning Curve Modeling

**Sigmoid Curve**: `M(N) = L / (1 + exp(-k(N - N₀)))`

Where:
- **L**: Maximum mastery level (asymptote)
- **k**: Learning rate (steepness)
- **N₀**: Inflection point (attempts to reach 50% mastery)

### Multi-Objective Loss Function

```
Total_Loss = λ₁×Binary_CrossEntropy + λ₂×Curve_MSE + λ₃×Regularization
```

- **Binary_CrossEntropy**: Standard correctness prediction loss
- **Curve_MSE**: Learning curve fitting quality

## How Cosine Similarity is Calculated in SimAKT

```

  1. Trajectory Construction from (S, N, M) Tuples

  The TrajectoryEncoder class (lines 368-429) processes the raw (S, N, M) tuples through neural network encoding:

  # For each interaction at time t:
  S = skill_id                                    # Skill identifier
  N = skill_attempts[skill]                       # Number of attempts on this skill
  M = skill_correct[skill] / skill_attempts[skill] # Mastery (success rate)

  # These are NOT used directly, but encoded:
  s_enc = self.skill_encoder(S)        # Linear(1, curve_dim/3)
  n_enc = self.attempts_encoder(N)     # Linear(1, curve_dim/3)  
  m_enc = self.mastery_encoder(M)      # Linear(1, curve_dim/3)

  # Concatenate and project to embedding space:
  tuple_enc = concat([s_enc, n_enc, m_enc])       # [curve_dim]
  trajectory_embedding = self.trajectory_proj(tuple_enc)  # Linear(curve_dim, emb_size)

  2. Cosine Similarity Computation

  The TSMiniSimilarity class (lines 432-486) computes similarity between embedded trajectories:

  # Step 1: Normalize trajectory embeddings
  query_norm = F.normalize(query_trajectory, p=2, dim=-1)   # L2 normalization
  key_norm = F.normalize(key_trajectories, p=2, dim=-1)

  # Step 2: Compute cosine similarity via dot product of normalized vectors
  cosine_sim = torch.matmul(query_norm, key_norm.transpose(-2, -1))
  # This gives values in range [-1, 1]

  3. Mathematical Transformations (The "4 Views")

  The cosine similarity is then transformed into 4 different "views" (lines 474-484):

  # View 0: Sigmoid of direct cosine similarity
  similarities[:, :, :, 0] = sigmoid(cosine_sim)

  # View 1: Squared similarity (emphasizes high similarity)
  similarities[:, :, :, 1] = sigmoid(cosine_sim ** 2)

  # View 2: Exponential similarity
  similarities[:, :, :, 2] = sigmoid(exp(cosine_sim - 1))

  # View 3: Linear transformation
  similarities[:, :, :, 3] = sigmoid(0.5 * cosine_sim + 0.5)
```

  Summary of the Process:

  1. (S, N, M) tuples → Neural network encoding → Trajectory embeddings (256-dim vectors)
  2. Trajectory embeddings → L2 normalization → Cosine similarity
  3. Cosine similarity → 4 mathematical transformations → Similarity scores

  Key Points:

  - The (S, N, M) tuples are NOT used directly for similarity calculation
  - They are encoded through learned neural networks into embedding vectors
  - The cosine similarity is computed on these learned embeddings, not the raw tuples
  - The "4 views" are simple mathematical transformations of the same base cosine similarity, not different similarity metrics

  This approach allows the model to learn useful representations of the trajectories through the encoding networks, rather than relying on fixed similarity measures between raw (S, N, M) values.
