# Analysis Documents Index

This index provides a quick reference to ablation and analysis artifacts currently in the `paper/` directory.

| File | Date | Purpose | Notes |
|------|------|---------|-------|
| `ABLATION_ANALYSIS_20251010_134105.md` | 2025-10-10 | Original GainAKT2Exp constraints vs "Traditional BCE" ablation | Baseline misconfigured (constraints not actually disabled); erratum appended 2025-10-16 |
| `ABLATION_ANALYSIS_20251016_225557_REDO.md` | 2025-10-16 | Corrected re-run with true pure BCE baseline (all weights zero) | Includes resolved weights and corrected methodology |
| `README_EXP.md` | 2025-10-16 | Formal definition of full vs. baseline configurations and evaluation protocol | Reference for experimental setup & reporting template |

## Usage Guidance
- Cite the redo report for any claims about constraint impact.
- Reference the original report only for historical context, pairing it with the erratum disclaimer.

## Future Additions (Reserved Headings)
- Model architecture comparison summary
- Extended multi-dataset constraint efficacy analysis
- Interpretability metrics deep dive

(Keep this index updated when adding new analytical artifacts.)
